`start/stack/db` starts a db stack.

The primary database in this stack is accessible from the `vscode` development container, and is a target for the `test-runner` stack.

Set the `LATENCY_MS` environment variable to change the simulated network latency in this stack.

See `<repo>/docker/repl-lag-db/docker-compose.yaml` for more details about the stack.
